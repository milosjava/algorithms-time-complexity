 GUI implementation and sbt for project building.
   
   
## Requirements

* Java 8
* ScalaFX 8

## Run calculator

Enter the project  folder and type:

 ```
 sbt run
 ```
 
 
## Tests
 
 Code is developed by applying [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and tests are located in 
 folder **/src/test/scala-2.11**,  For running all tests enter the project folder and type:
 
 ```
 sbt test

## Library dependencies

* scalatest - test driven development
* scalafx - modern library for GUI
* scala-logging - for logging

More details about project libraraies (e.g. version etc..) can be found in file **build.sbt**


## Logs

Logs are located in **logs** folder.  Log settings are located in **resources/logback.xml**


## ScalaDocs

ScalaDocs can be generated by entering project folder and typing:

```
sbt doc
```

ScalaDoc will be generated in folder **scalaDoc**.  Open file **index.html** in browser in order to start 
browsing projects documentation


## Using a calculator

After running calculator will show up in the center of the screen as shown on the next image:

## Functionality 


### Calculations


This functionality supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, log on floating point and integer numbers.
 
 e.g.
 
 ```
 (2+(4-1))*5
 ```
 
 A number of samples is given in test file **CalculatorSpec.scala**.
 
 
 Source files that are implementing this functionality are:
 
 * Calculator.scala
 * TokenParser.scala
 * ShuntingYard.scala
 
 
Calculator.scala object has 2 methods : *calculate* and *rpn*.   Method *calculate* is a high level  
workflow that goes from receiving input string, parsing it to tokens, transforming to postfix and evaluating.
All these sub-functionalities are handled in separate methods.  e.g. method *rpn* evaluates postfix expression.
  
  
Normally humans tend to enter math expressions in inflix notation and that is what is expected as input to calculator. 
However , machines are more suitable  for evaluating postfix notation so workflow of data goes like this:
 
 * get inflix notation as input
 * create tokens by applying regex (method *getTokens* from Object **TokenParser**)
 * transform tokens to postfix notataion (method *infixToPostfix* from Object **ShuntingYard**)
 * Finally evaluate postfx and return value to GUI (method *rpn* from Object **Calculator**)
 
Probably the most interesting part is **ShuntingYard** algorithm. High overview of algorithm is:
 
 1. Loop through the tokens
 2. In case of operand, push to the  operand stack
 3. In case of operator:
 While there is an operator on top of the operator stack of precedence higher than or equal to that of 
 operator we are currently processing, pop it  and apply.
 Next, push the current operator on the operator stack.
 4. When we get to the end of the formula, apply any operators remaining on the stack, from the top down. 
 Then the result is the only item left on the operand stack (assuming well-formed input).
 
Here are few good resources for understanding this algorithm in details:
 
 * [oxfordmathcenter](http://www.oxfordmathcenter.com/drupal7/node/628)
 * [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm)
 
For evaluating that posfix notation again stack is used and it is pretty straight forward as shown in 
method **rpn** in file Calculator.scala  Here , the biggest catch is to make sure that *logarithm* is unary 
operand. 


### Simple linear equation


Calculator also supports solving linear equations.  For  simplicity, only addition and multiplication operations are 
allowed as described in the task text.

Here's example of the linear equation:

```
2 * x + 0.5 = 1    , and response should be x=0.25
```

This functionality is located in these classes:

* ShuntingYard.scala
* LinearEquation.scala


ShuntingYard was again used for creating postfix notation as in standard calculator mode.  Interesting part related to 
equation solving is actually located in **LinearEquation.scala**


Main idea is to transform both sides of the equation to the form:
 
 
 ```
 m1 * x + b1 =  m2 * x +b2
 ```
 
 From this form it is very easy to isolate variable **x**
 
 ```
 x=  (b2 - b1) / (m1 - m2)   
 ```
 
 which is solution to linear equation. 
 
 
 So main obstacle is to transform left and right side of equation to the form :  m * x + b
 In order to accomplish this task similar way of evaluating was used  as in method **rpn** from file Calculator.scala
 Again data structure Stack has proved useful. However , in this case it is not possible to evaluate pieces of the
  expression and push to the stack cause value of x variable is not known.
  
  Solution to this problem is to represent all non operation tokens as two elements Array which represents m and b. 
  These arrays will be pushed and popped from the stack
  e.g.  
  
  ```
  variable        x ->  (1,0)
  ```
  
  ```
  expression:  2*x+1 -> (2,1)
  ```
  
  ```
  number:     4.2 ->  (0,4.2)
  ```
  
  Next , we have to define rules for applying binary operands (+,*) in this space on Array(m0,b0) and Array(m1,b1) 
   
  For addition (+) rule is:
  
  ```
  Array(m0,b0) + Array(m1,b1)  = Array(m0 + m1,b0 + b1)
  ```
  
  For multiplication (*) rules are:
  
  ```
  if(m0>0) ->   Array(m0,b0) * Array(m1,b1) = Array(m0 * b1,b0 * b1)
  ```
  
  and
  
  ```
  if(m1>0) ->   Array(m0,b0) * Array(m1,b1) = Array(b0 * m1,b0 * b1)
  ```
